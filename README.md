# sequence_detector_101_non_overlapping
Verilog implementation of a Non-Overlapping 101 Sequence Detector. This project includes the RTL code, testbench, and simulation waveforms. The detector uses a finite state machine (FSM) to identify the binary sequence 101 in a serial input stream and ensures non-overlapping detection. The design has been verified using Vivado Simulator.
